    <h2>HTTP & HTML</h2>

    <p>HTML & HTTP are important things to take into account when navigating the web
        . Web browsing works though an application that one uses to do so, such as google
        chrome, internet explorer or mozilla firefox. The user would type in the
        website URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator, into the search
        engine to get to their website. Computers communicate with servers for the
        website, both communicating HTTP, which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. </p><br>
    <h3>HTTP</h3>
    <p>HTTP is the language that web browsers and servers use to communicate. It is
        mainly made up of get requests, which essentially “gets” a page through
        it’s HTML code. Get requests aren’t the only requests made to servers,
        at times one sends information to the server through forms that the user
        fills out. This is an HTTP “post” request.HTTP is the language that web

    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is what every website is made
        up of, almost like its building blocks. It is the language that is used to
        tell a browser how a page is going to look. Tags are used to pinpoint
        specific things to be changed. The file sends information to the server for every
        page and video, as they each have their own links. <br>
        Cookies are what websites use to remember who the user is, which is a type of id
        card that identifies each user so that the web browser knows who the user is when using the website. <br>
        The internet is very open in that connections are shared and information is sent
        publicly in plain text. This allows for hackers to get personal information that one may put
        on a website. These are called secure sockets layers which allow websites to be safe from
        hackers as they communicate on a more secure channel. Knowing HTML basics is quintessential in
        understanding how the internet works.
