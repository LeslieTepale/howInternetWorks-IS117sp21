    <h2>Our Devices and Their Unique Addresses: IP Addresses & DNS</h2>
    <img src="images/keyboard.jpg" align="right" style="width: 320px; height: 213px">
    <p>There are many different connections that your device connects to in order
        to be able to access the
        internet and everything that comes with it such as IP Addresses. </p><br>
    <h3>Protocol</h3>
    <p>Protocol is an important set of rules and standards that everyone who works
        with the internet follows to communicate between machines. Itâ€™s important
        that all parties agree to use it. The Design philosophy of the internet has
        allowed for greater technological advances.
    </p><br>

    <h3>IP Addresses</h3><img src="images/ipAdd.jpg" align="right" style="width: 320px; height:213px">
    <p>All of the devices on the internet have an address that is a number, similar
        to a street address or a mailing address. IP addresses are part of the most
        important protocols of the internet. Information from machine to machine
        knows the ip address of the receiver. The data would also have the ip
        address of the sender. IP addresses are organized in a hierarchy of sorts,
        represented in bits, just like how data is organized. They show the country,
        network and subnetworks of the device. IP addresses are now becoming longer
        to accommodate for the growing number of devices that the world is developing.   </p>
    <h3>DNS</h3>
    <p>DNS stands for domain name system and it associates names with corresponding
        addresses. It allows for the device to be able to reach the information it
        is looking for. DNS servers are also organized into hierarchies, .com, .org,
        .net. However, DNS is susceptible to cyber attacks which allows users to end up in an unwanted website. </p>
