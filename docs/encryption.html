    <h2>Encryption Public Keys</h2>
    <img src="images/encryptkeyb.jpg" align="right" style="width: 320px; height: 213px">
    <p>The internet is a public system in that many servers and computers
        communicate to share information, despite the fact that some of that is
        private. This can include credit card information, bank statements or
        passwords. </p><br>
    <h3>Encryption</h3>
    <p>Encryption jumbles information so that the original message is scrambled into
        something different, to hide the information that can be private. Decryption
        unscrambles that message to get the message. <br>
        A key is a password that is only known by the sender and the receiver to
        decrypt a message. At times it can be difficult to encrypt a message securely
        as they are easily solvable and therefore easily hackable. Therefore, keys that
        include more digits and have much longer variation are much more secure as it
        would take a human many centuries to decrypt a message. <br>
        Longer encryptions allow for more combinations that one would have to make
        to decrypt a message, but they arenâ€™t necessarily harder.

    </p><br>

    <h3>Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption</h3>
    <p>Symmetric encryption is when the sender and receiver use the same key to both
        encrypt and decrypt a message. Though it's better for humans to come up with
        keys this way, computers are much more vulnerable because they are less private.
        <br>
        Computers use different keys for encryption and decryption for the message
        to be better protected. Public keys can be used to encrypt messages but private
        keys are those that can decrypt messages and only a computer has access to it.
